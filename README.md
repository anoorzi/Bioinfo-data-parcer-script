# Bio Info Script

## About Sampled

The mission of Sampled is to understand the genetic causes of common, complex diseases and to discover diagnoses, treatments and, eventually, cures for these diseases. To this end, we collaborate with researchers in the public and private sectors throughout the world, providing the highest quality biobanking services and biomaterials, as well as scientific and technical support.

## Description

The script is designed to help facilitate the parsing and checking of core pipeline output files giving incorrect datasets, so the datasets must be cross checked, examined and collected for futher review. (Data sent to Bio Informatics Team)
